When making a pitch:
Think:
Is this game worth making? 
Can we make it with our resources?

Do not talk too much about backstory - problem with too much lore; does not sell
as fast. Only set it up quickly.

Unless inventory system is unique, showcase it; otherwise, no.

Talk about your create vision; do not ask.

What makes your pitch unique? What would satisfy the need?

You never explained what the player feel.  Describe your mechanics and how 
players would feel.

Justify your decisions with real reason behind it, do not dismiss other
game designs because of "realism"

Don't feel the need to justify actions by some artifical frame.

No parody.

Never mentioned your glaring obvious tech risk; can this team succeed 
on making it? What's feasible and what's not?

Your proof of concept doesn't create your proof of concept.
Prototype key features of the game that makes it unique.

you don't have to have a lot of art on a pitch

Tell them what is the place holder or obvious place holder.

You polished too early. Focus more on mechanic than art.

Sample Dialog sucks: if it is story based game, make a really good dialouge.

Does this game really need the latest technology? 

You just pitched a phone game to a console game?
