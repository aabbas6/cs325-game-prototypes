    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
    <ul>
        <li> "This is pretty easy, I can make a game like this."
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
    <li> The player can move up, down, left, and right. The player can move towards other chickens. Once the player goes next to a chicken, it consumes it and grows exponentially.
